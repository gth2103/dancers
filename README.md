# Project-1

A web-based app that allows users to dynamically create a customized ice-cream cone, and get dietary information about the specific flavors available. Restaurants can streamline the selection process when users purchase ice-cream at their store. App provides a simple graphic user interface so that users can drag and drop their flavor into their cup or cone, and add their order to a virtual shopping cart before purchasing through the store.
